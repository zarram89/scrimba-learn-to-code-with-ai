##HERO

## Prompt 1
Your task is to create HTML and CSS for the HoverChair website's “hero” section. HoverChair is a hovercraft-inspired desk chair that floats slightly above the ground, providing a comfortable and exciting seating experience.

The hero section should include a main heading, subheading, short description paragraph, and a call to action link styled as a button. 

Consider the following guidelines for the code:
 * Ensure the code is easy to understand for non-coders by avoiding the use of complex CSS features.
 * Use an elegant and neutral color palette, with a focus on earthy tones and subdued hues.
 * Document each CSS property you use with a short code comment to explain its purpose.

Your final result should be an engaging and visually appealing hero section that effectively showcases the HoverChair brand.

## Prompt 2
Update the HTML and CSS by adding a small, rounded image named 'chair.png' above the hero heading. Add a soft shadow behind the image.
